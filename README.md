# Exploring Math with Eigenmath

There are the following booklets availabe:

### Elementary Differential Geometry

This is an introduction to Elementary Differential Geometry using the CAS Eigenmath. Code for the calculation of the 1st and 2nd fundamental form, for the shape operator, the GAUSS and mean curvature are presented in form of user-defined functions. The CHRISTOFFEL symbols, the RIEMANN tensors, the RICCI tensor and the curvature scalar R are also discussed via tensorial methodes with the build-in functions contract, dot and d. An implementation of the covariant derivative of vector fields are also given.
